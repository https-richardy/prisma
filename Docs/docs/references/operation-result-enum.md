# OperationResult Enumeration

## Overview

The `OperationResult` enumeration represents the result of an operation, providing a clear indication of whether the operation was successful or failed. It is a simple and effective way to communicate the outcome of an operation, especially in scenarios where the operation does not return a value.

## Usage

The `OperationResult` enum has two possible values:

- **Success**: Indicates that the operation was successful. This value is used when the operation completes without encountering any issues.

- **Failed**: Indicates that the operation failed. This value is used when the operation encounters an error or does not complete as intended.

### Example

```csharp
public OperationResult PerformOperation()
{
    try
    {
        // Logic for the operation

        return OperationResult.Success;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Handle the exception and return failure
        return OperationResult.Failed;
    }
}
```

### Remarks

The `OperationResult` enumeration is particularly useful in scenarios where:

* You need to communicate the outcome of an operation without relying on exceptions.
* You want to provide a straightforward indication of success or failure.
* Methods without a return value (void) can benefit from using `OperationResult` to convey results.

Using `OperationResult` can lead to more readble code, especially in scenarios where handling exceptions for flow control might be less desirable.
